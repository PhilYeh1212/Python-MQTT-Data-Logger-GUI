## 🚀 Why this tool?
Most free MQTT tools (like MQTT.fx or MQTT Explorer) are great for viewing data, but **hard to customize** or **integrate into your own logic**.

This project provides a **Full Python Source Code** template that handles:
* ✅ **Secure Auth:** Support for Username/Password & Custom Ports (essential for Cloud Brokers like HiveMQ/EMQX).
* ✅ **Paho-MQTT v2.0:** Compliant with the latest API standards (no deprecation warnings).
* ✅ **Auto CSV Logging:** Instantly saves `Topic`, `Payload`, and `Timestamp` to CSV.
* ✅ **Subscription Check:** Detects if the broker REJECTS your subscription (e.g., wrong wildcard usage).

---

## ✨ Features
* **GUI Interface:** Clean Tkinter UI. No HTML/JS knowledge required.
* **Non-Blocking:** Threaded architecture keeps the UI responsive.
* **Instant Export:** Data is saved to `mqtt_log.csv` in real-time.
* **Error Handling:** Visual feedback for connection failures or subscription rejections.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
Only one external library is required:
```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
```

📖 Code Snippet (Paho v2.0 Logic)
The code implements the latest callback API to ensure future compatibility:
```
Python

# Support for Paho-MQTT v2.0 Callback API
def on_subscribe(self, client, userdata, mid, reason_code_list, properties):
    # Check if subscription was granted (Code >= 128 means failure)
    if reason_code_list[0] >= 128:
        self.log_message(f"❌ Subscription REJECTED!")
    else:
        self.log_message(f"✅ Subscribed successfully.")

# Initialize with VERSION2 to avoid DeprecationWarning
self.client = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2)
```
